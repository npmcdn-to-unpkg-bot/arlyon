1,RFT,Rocketry Fundamentals Testing,"An exploratory program designed to test rocketry system for the first time.  Mission goals include landed part tests, and low altitude operations.  The program will conclude once a ship capable of reliably achieving orbit is designed and tested.",programs/SpaceX_CRS-3.png
2,TDC,Terresterial Data Collection,"Terresterial Data Collection is a program tasked with collecting information about Kerbin.  Early missions will focus on the area around KSC, later missions will cover any planet biome inclluding mapping the planet via sattelite recon.  The program will conclude once all science sample have been gather from every biome of Kerbin.",programs/SpaceX_CRS-7.png
3,MOO,Manned Orbital Operations,"Manned Orbital Operations is an umbrella program that captures all basic manned operations around Kerbin, early missions will simply be to test and improve launch vehicles and collect orbital science results.  Some missions with specific goals may fall into other programs.  This program will likely remain open ended.",programs/energia1.png
4,KCN,Kerbin Communication Network,Kerbin Communication Network is intended to consturct a sattelite and ground comm network around Kerbin with the capability of tracking and communicating with any deep space probes of vehicles sent beyond kerbin SOI.  The program will likely remain open ended.,programs/new_horizons.png
